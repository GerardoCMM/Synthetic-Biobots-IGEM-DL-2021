# Synthetic-Biobots-IGEM-DL-2021
Information about Synthetic Biobots team participating during IGEM Design League 2021. Code and files.

In this repository you can find files and code that was used by Synthetic Biobots with the purpose of developing the IGEM Design League project for 2021. In the descriptions section of this ReadMe file you will find a description of each file in this repository and information such as licencing of the programs used and their usage in the project.


## Descriptions

* [model.pdb](model.pdb): ItÂ´s a file that contains the homodimer structure of ArsR protein from E. coli strain K12 substrain MG1655, this structure was predicted by homology modeling using [Swiss-model portal](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive).

* [model1_robetta.pdb](model1_robetta.pdb): A file containing momomer structure of ArsR protein from E. coli strain K12 substrain MG1655, this model was built using [Robetta structure prediction tool](https://robetta.bakerlab.org/submit.php), it was not used any template and the algorithm ussed was RoseTTAFold deep learning based modeling method.

* [alphafold2_model.pdb](alphafold2_model.pdb): This file includes the structure of ArsR protein from E. coli strain K12 substrain MG1655 predicted using [Moonbear server](https://www.getmoonbear.com/AlphaFold2) for ab initio protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2 algorithm.

     *The structure of this three models can be compared using a molecule visualization tool in order to see the high structure similarity between models.*

* [Arsenate.pdb](Arsenate.pdb):
